ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing crop production data to derive actionable insights. The dataset contains information about various crops, their production levels, area usage, and other key attributes. The script performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier detection, and data visualization.

âœ¨ Features
Data Cleaning:

Handles missing values in numeric columns by replacing them with the mean.
Removes duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
Outlier Detection:

Identifies outliers in numeric columns using the Z-score method.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Statistical summary of data, including missing values and descriptive statistics.
Insightful visualizations like crop production trends and relationships.
Visualizations:

Bar plots for the top 10 crops by production.
Line plots for yearly production trends categorized by seasons.
Scatter plots showcasing the relationship between area usage and production.

Top Crops by Production:

Identify the most productive crops based on total production.
Yearly Trends:

Analyze how production varies year-over-year for different seasons.
Production vs. Area:

Explore the relationship between land usage and production efficiency.


ðŸ“ˆ Visual Highlights
Top 10 Crops by Production:

A bar chart displaying the crops with the highest production levels.
Yearly Production Trends:

Line charts showcasing seasonal production trends across years.
Area vs. Production Scatter Plot:

Visualizing the correlation between area usage and production output.
This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing agricultural data and generating insights to optimize crop production strategies.
